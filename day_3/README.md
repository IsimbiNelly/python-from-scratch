DAY 3 SUMMARY NOTES. 

On Day 3 of my Python learning journey, I focused on understanding and applying conditional logic using if, elif, and else statements. I practiced making decisions in programs based on user input, comparisons, and logical conditions. Through hands-on tasks such as an even/odd number checker, a BMI calculator, rollercoaster ticket pricing systems, and a pizza delivery billing program, I learned how to use nested conditionals, variables, arithmetic operations, and logical operators like and. I also improved my ability to handle user input effectively by converting input types and making input case-insensitive. The day concluded with a final text-based Treasure Hunt game that combined all these concepts into a complete interactive program, strengthening my understanding of program flow and decision-making in Python.
