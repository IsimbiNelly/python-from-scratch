## Day 2 – What I Learned in Python

- Learned subscripting to get a character from a string.
- Worked with data types: integers, floats, strings, booleans.
- Used the type() function to check data types.
- Learned type conversion with int(), float(), and str().
- Practiced math operations and order of operations.
- Built a BMI calculator using input and formulas.
- Learned how to use round() to limit decimal places.
- Used assignment operators like +=.
- Learned f-strings to format output.
- Built a Tip Calculator to split a bill with a percentage tip.

## Summary

On Day 2, I learned how to work with different data types and convert between them. I practiced calculations, user input, and formatting output. I also built small projects (BMI and Tip Calculator) to apply these concepts.
